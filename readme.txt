The code of LRNL approach run via run.sh

The code required to download SHL and TMD dataset from the link mentioned in the papers.

After pre-processing it is simply supplied as input ot the three models (conventional, noise adaptive, and noise corrective).

The nosie adaptive model require the operation to obtain true labels matrix from the noisy labels matrix.

The training time vary from machine-to-machine and epoch for training.
